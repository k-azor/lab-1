# Lab-1 Ashesi Personal Blog

What was once just an example repository, this is now going to be a personal blog.

Primary purpose is to get me well acquainted with git, github, and all the intricacies of web development.
Secondary purpose; I might get a cool website out of this.

There's an index.html in this repo, so keep an eye out for it.

That's the link- it should take you to what I have gotten so far.
