    <h1>Kenneth's Portfolio</h1>
    <p>I'm Kenneth, and it's past midnight. I'm tired, but I can't rest until I'm done with what I wanted to do. Not yet.<br>
    It will be worth it, though!

    <p>Hey! I am a Computer Science student of Ashesi University, graduation year 2022! <br> 
        I'm interested in music- all types of music. Really. Music is amazing. <br> 
        I'm thinking of becoming a musician myself- although sometimes, I worry my musical ideas are a bit too radical. <br> Only one way to find out, right?</p> 
    <p>I'm from Ghana, West Africa. We've got really good food!
    </p>

    <p>I'm a bit behind in my WebTech class, but I've still learnt quite a lot;</p>
